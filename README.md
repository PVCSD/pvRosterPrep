# pvRosterPrep
A rewrite of the tool to make rostering easier

A Shiny App to help with rostering students. Data is manually pulled from infinite campus, uploaded to the shiny app and the prepared file is downloaded. Should make restoring go a little faster than doing a multi-step process in excel.
